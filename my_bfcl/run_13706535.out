Answer:  None of the provided functions directly calculate the power of the magnetic field; they calculate the magnetic field strength. However, based on the available functions, we can use the 'electromagnetism.biot_savart_law' function to calculate the magnetic field strength first. Please note that we cannot calculate magnetic field power without additional information such as the area over which the field acts or the velocity of a charged particle moving through the field, among other factors. Assuming you want to calculate the magnetic field strength first, here is the function call:

Inferencing case id multiple_180, question: Fetch athlete statistics of 'Zelda' on Switch for user 'Sam'.
Answer:  It seems there might be some confusion in your request. The function `game_stats.fetch_player_statistics` is intended for fetching statistics of a video game player, not an athlete. Additionally, there is no function listed here that directly fetches athlete statistics. However, based on the available function, I will assume you want to fetch the player statistics for a video game named 'Zelda' (which could refer to 'The Legend of Zelda' series) for a user named 'Sam' on the Nintendo Switch platform. Here is the function call:
