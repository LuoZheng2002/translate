inspect multiple_function_checker
which is inside ast_checker

multiple function checker checks:
1. if the number of functions matches
2. passes simple_function_checker

inspect simple function checker
=> Some complicated black box


inspect ast_checker's context
which is inside _evaluate_single_ast_entry
which is inside format_sensitivity_runner and ast_file_runner

format_sensitivity_runner is inside evaluate_task
ast_file_runner is inside evaluate_task

Don't know if is_format_sensitivity(test_category)

Most probably it is none of the specified categories (ast_file_runner)

inspect evaluate_task
which is inside runner
so the eval_runner's runner does not call the model but processes its output

todo: extract logics from evaluate_task, do not use a leaderboard

generate_results might be the function that calls the LLMs
