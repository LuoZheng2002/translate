The user didn't specify any rounding, so I can use the default or not include it since it's optional. The function description says it's optional with a default, so I can choose to include it or not. But to be precise, I should call the function with the given parameters.\n\nThe function call format should be: [func_name(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...)]\n\nSo, for kinematics.calculate_displacement, I need to set:\n\n- initial_speed=20\n\n- acceleration=10\n\n- time=5\n\nI can include rounding or not. Since it's optional and the user didn't specify, I'll omit it, and the default will be used.\n\nNow, the response should only contain the function call in the specified format, no other text.\n\nSo, the function call should be: [kinematics.calculate_displacement(initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5)]\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly named and in the right order, but since it's a dictionary in the function, the order might not matter, but I'll use the names as specified.\n\nAlso, the function description says it's in Python 3 syntax, so I should use the exact parameter names.\n\nFinally, I should only return this function call if it's appropriate. In this case, it is, because the function matches the question and all required parameters are provided.\n\nThe user's question is in Chinese, but the parameters are clear: initial speed 20 m/s, acceleration 10 m/s\u00b2, time 5 s.\n\nNo other functions are needed, as displacement is directly calculable with this one function.\n\nSo, my response should be: [kinematics.calculate_displacement(initial_speed=20, acceleration=10, time=5)]"}

The date is given as 2019\u5e7412\u670813\u65e5, which translates to 2019-12-13 in the required format.\n\nNow, looking at the available functions:\n\n- \"weather.get_by_city_date\": This requires a city and a date, but the user provided coordinates, not a city. So, I can't use this because it needs a city name.\n\n- \"weather.get_forecast_by_coordinates\": This is for forecasts, not historical data. It requires coordinates and an optional days_ahead. But the user is asking for a specific past date (2019-12-13), so this is for future forecasts, not historical. This won't work.\n\n- \"weather.get_by_coordinates_date\": This seems perfect. It retrieves historical weather data based on coordinates and date. It requires both coordinates and date.\n\nThe parameters for \"weather.get_by_coordinates_date\" are:\n\n- coordinates: a tuple of floats (latitude, longitude)\n\n- date: a string in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nThe user provided coordinates as \"\u5750\u680746.603354,1.8883340\", which is latitude 46.603354 and longitude 1.888334. I need to format this as a tuple of floats.\n\nThe date is 2019\u5e7412\u670813\u65e5, which should be formatted as \"2019-12-13\".\n\nSo, I should call the function \"weather.get_by_coordinates_date\" with:\n\n- coordinates: (46.603354, 1.888334) \u2013 I need to make sure it's a tuple of floats.\n\n- date: \"2019-12-13\"\n\nThe user specifically asked for wind speed and temperature. The function description says it retrieves historical weather data, but it doesn't specify what data it returns. However, since it's a weather function, it's reasonable to assume it might include temperature and wind speed, or at least some weather metrics. I should call this function to get the data, and then perhaps I can extract the wind speed and temperature from the response.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)].\" And I should only return the function calls.\n\nAlso, \"Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability.\"\n\nIn this case, one function call should suffice to get the weather data for that date and coordinates. Then, based on the response, I might need to parse it, but since the system will handle the function call and return the data, I don't need to call multiple functions here unless the data isn't sufficient.\n\nThe user is asking for specific metrics: wind speed and temperature. I need to ensure that the function returns these. Looking at the function descriptions, none explicitly say what fields are returned, but \"weather.get_by_coordinates_date\" is for historical weather data, so it should include standard metrics like temperature and wind speed.\n\nIf after calling this function, I have the data, I can answer the question. But in this response, I only need to output the function calls.\n\nAlso, the date format: I need to convert \"2019\u5e7412\u670813\u65e5\" to \"2019-12-13\". The function expects a string in YYYY-MM-DD format, so I should do that.\n\nCoordinates: The user said \"\u5750\u680746.603354,1.8883340\" \u2013 there's a trailing 0 in the longitude, but it's probably 1.888334. I'll use (46.603354, 1.888334) as floats.\n\nNow, is there any other function I need to call? For example, if I need to convert the date or something, but no, I can directly use the provided information.\n\nSo, the function call should be: weather.get_by_coordinates_date(coordinates=(46.603354, 1.888334), date=\"2019-12-13\")\n\nIn the parameters, it's specified as a tuple, so in the call, I need to represent it as a tuple. In the format, it should be something like coordinates=(46.603354, 1.888334)\n\nAlso, ensure that the values are of correct type: floats for coordinates, string for date.\n\nI think that's it. No other functions seem necessary.\n\nFinally, output only the function call in the specified format."}
