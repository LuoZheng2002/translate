Write a short poem about the moon and the sea. The moon and the sea,
A sight to see,
The moon's glow so bright,
Reflects on the sea at night.

The waves dance and sway,
As the moon's light does play,
A peaceful and calming sight,
A moment to cherish and delight.

The moon and the sea,
A perfect harmony,
A reminder of nature's grace,
A moment to find peace in this place.
